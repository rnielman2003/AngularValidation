# AngularValidation
Validation of Forms in Angular with nice arrow Descriptions. 

It is using Angular 1.3.10

This is designed to upon form submit highlight the first field with an error then a popup arrow tells you why the validation didn't pass. Could be useful for particular validation instructions needed for the field to pass.
